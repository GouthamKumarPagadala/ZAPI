# ZAPI
Test execution and reporting on Jira + Zephyr setup

# Selenium WebDriver + Jira + Zephyr
Ever wondered how to integrate your automation framework with your test cases written on Jira? ZAPI allows you to do just that. You link your automation test suites with test cases written on Zephyr + Jira setup. 

When you run tests, you mention a test cycle under which you want the tests to be excuted. ZAPI will then run those tests and update each test case as pass/fail/unexecuted. This result in test case and automation result aggregation at a single place. Plus, you get all the benefits of Jira such as automation execution status, test execution dashboards, test metrics aggregation, etc.
